# Text Encryption

This repository contains a simple web application for text encryption and decryption using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm. The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic principles of encryption and decryption in the browser.

## Features:

- **Text Encryption:** Enter a text in the provided textarea and encrypt it using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm.
- **Text Decryption:** Decrypt the encrypted text and view the original message.

## How to Use:

1. **Encryption:**
   - Enter the text in the "Enter Text" textarea.
   - Click the "Encrypt" button.
   - The encrypted text will be displayed in the "Result" section.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Copy the encrypted text.
   - Paste the encrypted text in the "Enter Text" textarea.
   - Click the "Decrypt" button.
   - The decrypted text will be displayed in the "Result" section.

## Note:
- Ensure that you securely share the encrypted text with the intended recipient, as decryption requires the original encryption key.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to this project!
